# MovieRecommenderBot
Movie recommender chatbot created for CS124 (NLP) at Stanford. Worked with legends Hang Jiang and Richard Kahn.

How To Run:
1) Run the repl.py file in your terminal (ex: python repl.py --creative)
2) Tell the chatbot about 5 movies you like or dislike
3) Enjoy recommendations based on your individual movie preferences, genre partiality, and similar users

NOTES: 
- Use the --creative flag for the best performance/features (not adding the creative flag forces you to chat with a basic/frustrating movie recommender bot)
- Dataset contains a total of 9125 movies rated by 671 users. Ratings range anywhere from 1.0 to 5.0 with increments of 0.5.
- The sentiment lexicon consists of 3626 words with their associated sentiment extracted from Harvard Inquirer (Stone et al. 1966)
